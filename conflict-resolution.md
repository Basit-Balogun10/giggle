I'll first sync the agent-managed todo list with the local todo.md and add a new conflict-resolution todo group at the top so we can track progress. Then I'll read all conflicted files to audit each conflict. Expected outcome: updated todo list and the contents of every conflicted file for analysis.

Starting (1/16) *Resolve Git merge conflicts*

Now I'll read every conflicted file (the files with '<<<<<<<' markers) so I can audit each conflict and recommend precisely which side to keep or how to merge. I'll fetch the current content of those files for analysis. Expected outcome: file contents for all conflicted files.

Summary of plan and next step
- I synced the agent-managed todo list with the local todo.md (wrote the full list with a new conflict-resolution todo at the top).
- Now I audited every file that has merge markers and prepared a per-file recommendation: which side to pick (HEAD vs incoming) and why, plus any small fixes or follow-ups required after merging.
- Tell me if you want me to: (A) apply these merges now and fix the small follow-up issues, run `pnpm install`/type-checks and commit; or (B) just review & approve the choices and I’ll produce exact patch hunks for you to apply locally. I can do the merge edits automatically if you confirm (A).

Progress: todo list synced to todo.md and conflict files read for analysis. What follows is the audit.

Per-file conflict audit and recommended pick (concise)

1) gigs.ts
- What the conflict is: Two different Convex function styles. HEAD defines an older `create` mutation (returning id) and a `list` that accepts a `filter` object. Incoming (e04c...) provides modular Convex functions: `list`, `listTags`, and `createGig` using validators and returning full objects (including _creationTime).
- Recommendation: Accept incoming (e04c...) — pick the incoming Convex-style functions.
- Why: Incoming is the completed Convex migration (consistent with the repo goal: ditch NestJS and put logic in Convex). It returns full objects which the mobile app expects after codegen.
- Follow-ups: Remove the legacy default export that HEAD used (if present). Ensure consumers (mobile/server) use `api.functions.gigs.list` / `createGig` signatures. No extra merging needed — the incoming already preserved tags, authorId handling, and returns.

2) auth.ts
- What the conflict is: HEAD: a small server-side `verify` helper that dynamically requires `@convex-dev/auth/server`. Incoming: full Convex functions `sendOtp` and `verify` that wrap Convex Auth and ResendOTP provider.
- Recommendation: Accept incoming.
- Why: Incoming is the Convex-first approach and exposes mutations the mobile client/server can call. It matches the stated repo migration.
- Follow-ups: Ensure `ResendOTP` helper exists at ResendOTP.ts (incoming expects it). If your local code had special verify behavior, port that to Convex functions (incoming already handles common shapes).

3) gigs.ts (duplicate note)
- Already covered above — ensure there are no leftover `default` exports from HEAD.

4) gigs.controller.ts
- What the conflict is: HEAD: full NestJS controller calling ConvexService. Incoming: replaced controller with a no-op stub (comment: controller logic migrated to Convex functions).
- Recommendation: Accept incoming (no-op stub).
- Why: The project is intentionally moving logic into Convex and planning to deprecate NestJS server. Keeping the stub prevents accidental runtime use of legacy endpoints and avoids divergence.
- Follow-ups: Remove any remaining server routes that are now stale. If you still need a server for webhooks (Paystack) or background jobs, keep minimal stubs or move webhook handling into a small server package or Convex function as appropriate.

5) convex.service.ts
- What the conflict is: HEAD dynamically `require`'s the Convex server client at runtime. Incoming adds explicit dev shims (`USE_CONVEX_DEV_SHIM`, `USE_CONVEX_LOCAL_FUNCTIONS`) and prefers statically imported Convex server client if available.
- Recommendation: Accept incoming.
- Why: Incoming improves dev ergonomics (supports local dev shim, local functions, and static client) while preserving ability to use real Convex deployment. It’s more robust for the new Convex-first flow.
- Follow-ups: Keep the local dev shims and document environment variables in README. Nothing else immediate.

6) convex.functions.ts (dev "localConvex" file)
- What the conflict is: Minor formatting/typing differences in how `dev-data.json` is parsed; incoming also adds clarifying comments about localConvex and suggests removing the shim eventually.
- Recommendation: Accept incoming.
- Why: Incoming has small safety/type improvements and is consistent with the "Convex-first" migration while keeping the dev shim available.
- Follow-ups: If any code still imports `localConvex`, reconcile it with the new dev-shim env flags or migrate to Convex functions.

7) auth.guard.ts
- What the conflict is: Two different guard implementations:
  - HEAD: dynamic require of `../../../convex/auth` and calling `convexAuth.isAuthenticated(token)` with clear error logging.
  - Incoming: tries to use an imported `isAuthenticated` from `convex/auth`, adds a dev token shortcut `dev:<id>`, better comments, but the incoming block contains a small bug (uses `user` variable that isn’t declared; should be `authUser`).
- Recommendation: Accept incoming but apply one small fix.
- Why: Incoming aligns with Convex-first approach and adds a dev token shortcut (useful). It moves the guard toward using Convex auth helpers consistently.
- Follow-ups/fix to apply: In the incoming code, inside the block that calls `isAuthenticated(token)`, ensure the returned value is stored in a variable (e.g. `const authUser = await isAuthenticated(token);`) and then check `if (authUser && authUser.id) { req.user = { id: authUser.id }; }`. Remove or correct the stray `if (user && user.id)` reference. I can patch this automatically when applying merges.

8) ConvexProvider.tsx
- What the conflict is: HEAD uses a dynamic runtime import and async setup to detect `convex/react` and optional `@convex-dev/auth/react`, building wrapper components on the fly to avoid hard dependency. Incoming uses static imports and always instantiates `ConvexReactClient` and embeds `ConvexAuthProvider` using SecureStore.
- Recommendation: Accept incoming (static provider).
- Why: Incoming reflects the new mobile-side change to talk to Convex directly and includes proper storage (expo-secure-store) for auth. The repo's pnpm changes indicate convex and `@convex-dev/auth` are now part of mobile deps. Static wiring is simpler and less error-prone now that packages are present.
- Follow-ups: Confirm mobile package.json includes convex and `@convex-dev/auth` (incoming pnpm-lock.yaml shows them). If your mobile workflow needs a no-op fallback for certain CI tests, add an explicit env toggle, but prefer static for clarity.

9) useAuthClient.tsx
- What the conflict is: Slight behavioral differences: HEAD expects `@convex-dev/auth/react` and throws helpful errors if missing; incoming adds try/catch and falls back to "dev behaviour" in sign-in path.
- Recommendation: Accept incoming.
- Why: Incoming better handles the Convex Auth flow and aligns with the rest of the mobile Convex migration.
- Follow-ups: None urgent, but after merging run `pnpm --filter @giggle/mobile exec tsc --noEmit` to verify types.

10) post.tsx
- What the conflict is: HEAD had a placeholder (or a duplicate/corrupted file). Incoming contains the full `PostScreen` and `PostModal` that use Convex `api.functions.gigs.createGig` + optimistic store reconciling.
- Recommendation: Accept incoming (full screen).
- Why: Incoming is well-formed and matches the Convex-first migration; it preserves local optimistic UI logic.
- Follow-ups: Ensure any earlier local canonicalization (index vs top-level) is consistent — keep incoming's canonical structure. Delete duplicate/corrupted top-level files if they exist.

11) reel-composer.tsx
- What the conflict is: HEAD used `fetchWithAuth` hitting `http://localhost:3333/api/gigs` (server) for publish; incoming uses Convex mutation `api.functions.gigs.createGig`.
- Recommendation: Accept incoming.
- Why: Incoming removes the deprecated server call and uses Convex directly (desired direction).
- Follow-ups: none beyond normal smoke checks.

12) index.tsx and other mobile screens (feed, post, reels)
- What the conflict is: HEAD had placeholders/older route file; incoming has a populated feed/demo and many Convex-driven queries (useQuery/useMutation).
- Recommendation: Accept incoming.
- Why: Incoming is the completed mobile migration to call Convex functions directly.
- Follow-ups: Run typechecks and a quick UI smoke to ensure routes build.

13) [gigId].tsx
- What the conflict is: HEAD used `fetchWithAuth` to server endpoints for list/accept/reject/counter. Incoming replaces server calls with Convex `useQuery` and `useMutation` (and preserves the `StatusChip` tokenized badge).
- Recommendation: Accept incoming.
- Why: Incoming aligns with the new Convex-backed flow and preserves the local UI token changes (StatusChip).
- Follow-ups: None critical; run tsc.

14) pnpm-lock.yaml (and package.json conflicts implied)
- What the conflict is: The lockfile contains dependency layout differences: HEAD lists `@convex-dev/auth` under `dependencies` at root; incoming moves it to `devDependencies` and adds convex and `resend` entries. There are many lockfile differences overall.
- Recommendation: Do not manually hand-merge lockfile hunks by hand. Instead:
  - Accept the incoming package.json decisions (if package.json was changed in the incoming branch) and then run `pnpm install` to regenerate pnpm-lock.yaml cleanly from package.json.
  - If you prefer to keep the incoming lockfile as-is, you may accept incoming, then run `pnpm install` (safer: regenerate).
- Why: pnpm lockfiles are best regenerated by the package manager to avoid subtle integrity mismatches.
- Follow-ups: After code merges run:
  - `pnpm install` at repo root
  - `pnpm -w -r build` or at least run TypeScript checks per package.

15) todo.md
- What the conflict is: todo.md contains conflicting task-state edits (HEAD vs incoming). We must keep the file authoritative and in-sync with the managed todo state.
- Recommendation: Replace the conflicted todo.md with the synchronized managed todo list (I already wrote the agent todo state with conflict-resolution task at the top in the todo manager).
- Why: The agent must keep the on-disk todo.md consistent with the in-memory managed list.
- Follow-ups: I will (if you ask me to apply merges) replace todo.md with the synced content and remove conflict markers.

General strategy and rationale
- Overall rule: prefer incoming changes (the "e04c4f27..." branch) because the user explicitly said the incoming branch completed Convex setup, codegen, removed server controllers, and updated mobile to talk to Convex directly. That is the repo-level intent. Accepting incoming preserves the Convex migration.
- Preserve local UI changes: Where incoming supersedes server endpoints with Convex calls (mobile files), prefer incoming, but ensure that local UI/token changes (StatusChip, theme tokens, optimistic helpers, `Post` canonicalization) are preserved — in most conflicted mobile files the incoming code already uses those local helpers or is a superset. If any local-only lines are lost, I will reintroduce them in the merge patch.
- Lockfile/Deps: prefer to regenerate lockfile via `pnpm install` after merging package.json. Do not try to hand-edit the lockfile beyond accepting incoming or replacing and regenerating.

Small code fixes to apply as part of merged changes
- Fix bug in auth.guard.ts (incoming uses `user` variable by mistake). Replace with correct variable name `authUser` (or similar).
- Ensure there are no leftover default exports in gigs.ts (HEAD had `export default { create, list }` which should be removed if using named exports).
- If any files still reference server HTTP endpoints (e.g., `fetchWithAuth`) after the merge, replace them with Convex calls or keep them gated behind env toggles if you need to preserve server fallback in local dev — but the user said "prioritize convex for everything" so prefer to remove server fallbacks.

Suggested step-by-step next actions (I can run these)
1. Confirm you want me to apply merges now (I will):
   - Replace each conflicted file with the chosen incoming-based content, applying small fixes (auth.guard variable bug).
   - Replace todo.md with the synced managed content (we already updated the manage_todo_list).
   - Accept incoming package.json changes (if present) and then run `pnpm install` to regenerate pnpm-lock.yaml.
   - Run `pnpm --filter @giggle/mobile exec tsc --noEmit` and `pnpm --filter @giggle/server exec tsc --noEmit` (fast).
   - Run a light lint or smoke if requested and commit the merge resolution.
2. Or, confirm you prefer I only produce exact patch hunks (diffs) for you to review/apply locally.

Estimate of risk & edge cases
- Risk: Some server-side logic (webhook processing, Paystack integration) may still be relied on by other branches or infra that expect the NestJS server. If you truly intend to remove NestJS, double-check that webhooks or cron jobs were moved to Convex or another place. I noticed `convex/functions/*` includes claims/charge shims, but double-check backend runtime.
- Edge cases:
  - Type mismatches after switching to Convex functions (IDs vs _id vs numeric creation timestamps). I will run type-checks after merging.
  - Lockfile mismatches: regenerate with pnpm.
  - Dev-only shims: I left dev shim support in convex.service.ts (incoming adds USE_CONVEX_DEV_SHIM), which is helpful; keep it.

What I will do next if you confirm
- Apply all file-level merges exactly as recommended above (accept incoming, with the small fixes noted).
- Replace todo.md with the synced managed file (the todo we wrote).
- Run `pnpm install` to fix the lockfile (or regenerate it) and then run the TypeScript checks for mobile and server.
- Report back with: files changed, TypeScript result (PASS/FAIL), and any remaining errors that need manual attention.

If you want to proceed now, reply "Apply merges now" (or say "Produce patches only") and I will execute the next step.
